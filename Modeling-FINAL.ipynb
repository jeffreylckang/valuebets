    "## Analysis\n",
    "The analysis will be composed of 4 parts. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate whether a given game's home and away odds are considered value bets. One potential insight is that using multi-sport odds can improve this evaluation of value bet consideration because the odds market may not efficiently set odds with other sports in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1, I will first assess value bets by using a historically adjusted win rate for a team. This involves no modeling and is a simple calculation that shall act as my baseline for evaluating value bets. What this calculation involves is essentially comparing the historical win rate for a given team conditional on it being the home or the away team and the current implied probability of winning (conditional on the team being home or away). If the difference is positive, then it is a value bet. Then I will count the number of value bets derived from my model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few Parts, I will use modeling to predict the probability of winning for a team  based on various factors and then compare it to the implied probability of winning for that team of that specific game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 2, I will assess value bets by using Random Forests first to predict win probabilities and then I will use these predicted probabilities and compare them to the implied probabilities based on the current game's odds set by the bookies. I will then determine whether or not the predicted probabilites outputted by the model are considered value bets by seeing if the difference is greater than 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 3, I will assess value bets by using a Collaborative Filtering Neural Network to predict win probabilities. The procedure to compare probabilities to determine value bets is the same. In this part, I will train a \"base\" neural network that has shared embeddings from different sports and then use that to determine win probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 4, I will assess value bets by using a simple FeedForward Neural Network that is trained on only one sport. I will compare the Collaborative Filtering model and the feedforward model and see which one does better on a held out basketball season."

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
